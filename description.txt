Masomode DLC is a pretty cool mod... it does EVERYTHING! Ever wanted to play Thorium, but thought 'God, I just wish there were more enchantments to play with'? Think no more! (Much like half the development team). 
Now, the wondrous phenomenon that is Masochist mode can be with you everywhere! Be it Thorium, Calamity, or even Mod of Redemption when we give it support in about a million Fargo years, we've expanded the content!

Ever wanted to do Masodeath, but then realised that 'Oh no! This is about as buggy as tremor in multiplayer!' Now, with Masomode DLC, we've patched out these nasty bugs (and probably created some new ones, but they're smaller - honest!)
If you're looking for a unique experience, download Masomode DLC - you can bring any big mod you like along for the ride as well - just as long as it's not Jetshift, because I'll literally kill you if you use it.
Masomode DLC brings also along a whole heap of difficulty for all you tryhards- I mean experienced players! We branced out as much as we could - we changed AI, added debuffs, used unique changes to enemies to boost difficulty, added debuffs, carefully adjusted health and damage stats, and of course, we added debuffs.

Our development team consists of a group of dedicated modders, backed by the creators of the supported mods themselves - so we can assure you of a good experience (and if you don't, we can always blame Planterror, he sucks ass at coding anyways and he knows it).
